Create ec2 2 instances Linux and windows

Ansible Control node : 
Windows 10 node: 

Part 1

Step: 1
First we need to get Ansible installed on the Control node
Firstly, we need to confirm if Python3 is installed. go to the root user

# sudo dnf install python3

# sudo alternatives --set python /usr/bin/python3

check the verion 

# python --version


Step 2: Install a virtual environment for running Ansible
(This will keep at bay issues such as dependency problems and package conflicts.)

# sudo dnf install python3-virtualenv

After the installation of the virtual environment, create a virtual workspace by running:

# virtualenv env

# source env/bin/activate


Step 3: Install Ansible

# pip install ansible

Check the Version 

# ansible --version

To test Ansible and see if it’s working on our Ansible Control server run:

# ansible localhost -m ping

we need to define the Windows host or system on a host file on the Ansible control node. Therefore, open the default hosts file
# vim /etc/ansible/hosts

we need to define the Windows host or system on a host file on the Ansible control node. Therefore, open the default hosts file

[winhost]
Ip of the windows node

[winhost:wars]
ansible_user=Username
ansible_password=password
ansible_connection=winrm
ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation=ignore


Step 4: Install Pywinrm
For Unix systems where Ansible uses SSH to communicate with remote hosts, here To communicate with Windows hosts, you need to install Winrm.

# pip install pywinrm



Part 2

we are going to configure our Windows 10 remote host system to connect with the Ansible Control node. We are going to install the WinRM listener- short for Windows Remote – which will allow the connection between the Windows host system and the Ansible server.

Prerequisite
ensure that you are using Windows Server 2008 and later versions
system is running .NET Framework 4.0 and later.
Windows PowerShell should be Version 3.0 & later

WinRM can be installed using a script that you can download from
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible/devel/examples/scripts/ConfigureRemotingForAnsible.ps1


saved the file on the Desktop under the name  ConfigureRemotingForAnsible.ps1

Open the Powershell, Navigate to the script location and run it. 

.\ConfigureRemotingForAnsible.ps1

Part 3: Connecting to Windows Host from Ansible Control Node

To test connectivity to the Windows 10 host, run the command:

# ansible winhost -m win_ping


Part 4:

Creating and running a playbook for Windows 10 host to install the cloudwatchagent

cwaplaybook.yml


run the playbook

# ansible-playbook cwaplaybook.yml


The cloudwatch agent will be installed and configured in the windows host, we can check the log reports in AWS console
